                                                        <p>When a crippling disease shattered his lifelong ambition, Dr. Govindappa
                                                            Venkataswamy chose an impossible new dream: to eliminate curable blindness.
                                                            By 1976 he had personally performed over 100,000 sight-restoring surgeries.
                                                            That same year he founded Aravind, an 11-bed eye clinic in south India, with no
                                                            money, business plan or safety net. Dr. V (as he came to be known) was 58 years
                                                            old at the time, and over the next four decades his humble clinic would defy the
                                                            odds to become the largest provider of eye care in the world.</p>

                                                                    He entered medical school with plans to become an Obstetrician, and in 1944 joined the Army as Medical Officer. He was discharged in 1948 after developing severe rheumatoid arthritis which left his fingers badly crippled and changed the course of his life. He could no longer hope to enter the physically rigorous field of obstetrics. Instead, he re-joined Medical College, and with determination and perseverance, he earned his Diploma and Master Degree in Ophthalmology. With a willpower and dedication far beyond the ordinary, Dr. Venkataswamy went on to personally perform over one hundred thousand successful eye surgeries.</p>

Sir John Wilson, a blind man of great vision and founder of Sight Savers International, greatly influenced Dr. V and would go on to mentor him to approach eye care from a global perspective.<br><br>
                                                                        Dr. V dreamt of being able to market “good eye sight” to the world, the way McDonald’s sells hamburgers. He wanted to create a mechanism of delivery of eye care, the same way and make it available in every corner of the world.<br><br>
                                                                        Dr. V’s enduring contribution to the world of ophthalmology by pioneering a unique, financially self-sustaining model of eye care delivery has profoundly influenced the way millions have accessed affordable eye care in India and the rest of the developing world.<br><br>
                                                                        He always believed that “if work is approached from a spiritual perspective then it becomes divine work. If in your actions you allow the divine force to flow through you, you will accomplish things far greater than you might have imagined” <br><br>
                                                                        Dr. V blended his spiritual life to his daily work remarkably well. As a young man, he became a disciple of Sri Aurobindo, an Indian philosopher and saint who lived in service to God and man. Aravind Eye Care System was founded on this principle of service and continues to be guided by it. In 1991, as part of the Wit lecture series, Dr. V was invited to deliver an address at the Harvard Divinity School on the theme of living a spiritual life in the contemporary age. The address entitled ‘Illuminated Spirit’, has been published and read by many people.

In discussing his work as a spiritual practice, Dr. V has said, ‘’ When I go to meditation room at the hospital every morning, I ask God that I be a better tool, a receptacle for the divine force. We can all serve humanity in our normal professional lives by being more generous and less selfish in what we do. You don’t have to be a ‘religious’ person to serve God. You serve God by serving humanity.’’

Dr V's life was a long dedication to serving the Divine through work in the field of eye care. His tireless vision, inspiring leadership as well as his selflessness and humility shaped Aravind into all that it is today.

                                                    <p>In 1976, at the mandatory retirement age, fifty eight year old  <strong>Dr. V</strong> left Government service with a retirement project in mind – the Aravind Eye Hospital. Sir John Wilson, a blind man of great vision and founder of Sight Savers International, greatly influenced <strong>Dr. V</strong> and would go on to mentor him to approach eye care from a global perspective.</p>

                                                  <p><strong>Dr. V</strong> dreamt of being able to market “good eye sight” to the world, the way McDonald’s sells hamburgers.  He wanted to create a mechanism of delivery of eye care, the same way and make it available in every corner of the world.<br><br>
                                                    <strong>Dr. V’s</strong> enduring contribution to the world of ophthalmology by pioneering a unique, financially self-sustaining model of eye care delivery has profoundly influenced the way millions have accessed affordable eye care in India and the rest of the developing world.<br><br>
                                                      He always believed that “if work is approached from a spiritual perspective then it becomes divine work.  If in your actions you allow the divine force to flow through you, you will accomplish things far greater than you might have imagined”
                                                      <br><br>
                                                      <strong>Dr. V</strong> blended his spiritual life to his daily work remarkably well. As a young man, he became a disciple of Sri Aurobindo, an Indian philosopher and saint who lived in service to God and man. Aravind Eye Care System was founded on this principle of service and continues to be guided by it.  In 1991, as part of the Wit lecture series, <strong>Dr. V</strong> was invited to deliver an address at the Harvard Divinity School on the theme of living a spiritual life in the contemporary age. The address entitled ‘Illuminated Spirit’, has been published and read by many people.

                                                    <p><strong>Dr. V</strong> begins and ends every day at the hospital with a visit to the meditation room for ‘a silent talk with God’. In discussing his work as a spiritual practice,  <strong>Dr. V</strong> has said, ‘’ When I go to meditation room at the hospital every morning, I ask God that I be a better tool, a receptacle for the divine force.  We can all serve humanity in our normal professional lives by being more generous and less selfish in what we do. You don’t have to be a ‘religious’ person to serve God. You serve God by serving humanity.’’</p>

                                                        Aravind Eye Care System will remember the year 2006 as the year it lost its founder, <strong>Dr. V</strong> on July 7. <strong>Dr V's</strong> life was a long dedication to serving the Divine through work in the field of eye care. His tireless vision, inspiring leadership as well as his selflessness and humility shaped Aravind into all that it is today.
